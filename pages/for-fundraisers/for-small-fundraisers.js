          <p>
          Right now, you need to rely on people in your personal network for donations. We are trying to get you support from strangers abroad. To do this, we need to communicate that you are who you say you are and that you will spend the money the way you promised. We have thought of a few ways to create trust between you and the philanthropists, the main one being:
          </p>
          <br />   
          <p>
            Your request for donation has to come from a credible social media account.
          </p>
          <p> <span className='rounded-full bg-textAccent-yellow m-2 inline-block p-1'>The fundraisers should be hosted on:</span></p>
          <ul>
            <li className='mt-2'>ðŸ‘‰ <b>a social media page of the battalion, your volunteer group, etc.</b> 
            <br />The page should have been active for the past few months, have some following, and preferably include some photo evidence of previous aid purchases</li>
            <li className='mt-2'>ðŸ‘‰ <b>OR a social media of someone credible who is endorsing your project</b>
            <br />This person could be a local activist, supporter abroad, political figure, industry professional, etc. This person should have a meaningful social reputation and be willing to vouch for you. <b>Please share this guide with them: <a href='https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xrf6CwJ0n6cAqccjf-Q85MlnLrzkqnZMDfjNa5xwAEQ/edit?usp=sharing' className=" font-medium text-lg text-uablue-default underline underline-offset-4 hover:text-uablue-accent" target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'>link</a></b></li>
